Requirement: Download & install Tesseract-OCR and copy the installed/saved path to code as I have it in line 25.  Please find the Tesseract-OCR software [here](

Also, to note: Image file must be in the same location as the code file.
- Run and enter the filename including its extension in the program. For example: computer.jpg
- Wait for few seconds till the program ends its running (import image will be displayed).
- Finally, check for the saved text document in the same location as the image file & code file. Saved as “exp_txt”.

    Using Spyder IDLE?
    Just open “exp_txt” in variable explorer panel

Please edit the saved text document just in case some alphabets are mistaken for another.
